## 🎯 Key Architecture Insight

### Why SLMU Checking Happens in Callosum

**Previous Architecture (Incorrect):**
```
User Input → Prismo → SLMU Check (linguistic only) → ...
                   ❌ No access to Chroma's emotion data
```

**Current Architecture (Correct):**
```
User Input → [Chroma + Prismo + Anchor] → Callosum → SLMU v2.0 Check
             ↓ Emotions   ↓ Concepts   ↓ History      ↓ Full Context
                                                        ✅ Linguistic + Emotional
```

**Benefits:**
1. ✅ **Full Context**: Both linguistic AND emotional data available
2. ✅ **Single Checkpoint**: All ethical decisions in one place
3. ✅ **v2.0 Features**: Emotion validation requires Chroma's scores
4. ✅ **Clean Separation**: Triads analyze, Callosum judges
