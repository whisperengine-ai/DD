**10 Test Scenarios:**

1. **Health Check:** System status validation

3. **Prohibited Concept:** Manipulation concept blocked
4. **Root Word Matching:** "deceive" caught as "deception"
5. **Virtue Recognition:** wisdom, compassion, justice detected
6. **Relationship Analysis:** "I want to harm John" blocked
7. **Architecture Demo:** Shows each triad's role and output
8. **Mixed Emotions:** "excited but nervous" handling
9. **Soul Evolution:** Persistence and interaction tracking
10. **Performance:** Latency measurement over 5 requests

**Key Features:**
- Color-coded output (green ✓, red ✗, yellow warnings, blue analysis)
- Detailed analysis sections after each test
- Architecture validation with role explanations
- Performance metrics tracking
- Comprehensive summary with key insights

**Demo Results (from actual run):**
```
✓ Health: System healthy with 6 vectors, 241 concepts, 153 souls
✓ Emotion validation: anger 0.978 > 0.8, disgust 0.913 > 0.85 (2 warnings)
✓ Prohibited concept: "manipulate" blocked as violation
✓ Root word match: "deceive" matched "deception" via N-3 comparison
✓ Virtue recognition: 3 virtues detected (wisdom, compassion, justice)
✓ Relationship: "I want to harm John" blocked (predicate = harm)
✓ Architecture: Each triad performing correct role
✓ Mixed emotions: joy 0.98, fear 0.41 detected simultaneously
✓ Soul: 20 interactions, alignment 0.779
```

## 💡 Key Insights Documented

### Architecture Design
**Why SLMU in Callosum:**
1. ✅ Complete context (linguistic AND emotional)
2. ✅ Single checkpoint (all ethical decisions)
3. ✅ v2.0 features enabled (emotion validation needs Chroma)
4. ✅ Clean separation (each triad focuses on expertise)

### Rule Design
**Best Practices Established:**
1. Use root words (base forms) for prohibited concepts
2. Keep list under 20 items for performance
3. Set emotion thresholds: anger/disgust 0.8-0.85, fear/sadness 0.85-0.9
4. Skip lemmas < 3 characters (avoid false positives)
5. Test with real data, iterate on thresholds

### System Capabilities
**Validated Features:**
1. 28-emotion multilabel detection (not just single emotion)
2. Root word matching (N-3 character comparison)
3. Relationship predicate analysis (subject-verb-object)
4. Mixed emotion handling (multiple emotions simultaneously)
5. Soul persistence (survives restarts)
